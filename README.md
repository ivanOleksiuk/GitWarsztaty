# Fibonacci Numbers in Java

This project demonstrates how to generate Fibonacci numbers using Java. It includes two approaches — one iterative and one recursive — to help learners understand different programming paradigms and performance considerations.

---

## Project Purpose

The **goal** of this project is to:

- Introduce fundamental algorithms** using the Fibonacci sequence as a classic example.
- Compare different approaches** (iterative vs recursive) to solving the same problem.
- Help learners understand:
  - Basic control flow (loops, conditionals)
  - Recursion and its trade-offs
  - How performance and efficiency vary between implementations
